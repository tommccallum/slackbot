It all seems easy when they talk about it but, I don't know, I just don't get it.  Jeff said he has already done reflections for all of the first modules learning outcomes and some of the other modules!  Tanya was getting on my nerves at the meeting today saying how well she was doing - drove me nuts :angry:  Sorry for the rant - hows things with you?",

I wish I had a study or somewhere quiet to go in the evenings.  How are you getting on with the reflections?",
